In the master table, there is a row per hospital per measure. A given row is considered a high quality obersvation if it is in the top 10% of all instances of that measure (or the bottom 10% if a low score is considered good, as defined by table mid_qual). The hospitals with more quality counts are considered superior.

This is defined as the following 10 hospitals:
