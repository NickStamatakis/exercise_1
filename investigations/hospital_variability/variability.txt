High variability procedures are defined as those that are often outside of two standard deviations for the avarege. High percentages of instances beyond this are indicative of wide distributions.

For each procedure/hospital line, a procedure was considered variable if it was beyond two standard deviations. Procedures with the highest percentage of variable observations were considered most variable.
